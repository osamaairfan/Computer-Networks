### Task 01:
**Command:** `ipconfig`

**Ip address:** `192.168.1.104`

### Task 02:
**Command:** `ipconfig /all`

**Ip address:** `192.168.1.104`

**Mac address:** `8C-70-5A-56-4F-BC`

**Gateway:** `192.168.1.1`

**DHCP Enabled:** yes 

## Task 03:
Command: `hostname`

**Hostname:** HP

## Task 04:
**Command:** `ping`

**Reason:** Two devices can be connected with each other using ping command with a target Ip address. Reasons for no connectivity could be the devices are not on the same network.

## Task 05:
**Command:** `netstat -ano`

## Task 06:
**Command:** `tracert`

**No. of hops:** 30

**Ip address of google:** `142.250.181.132`

## Task 07:
**Reason:** While pinging a hostname like "blue machine," the computer needs to translate that hostname into an IP address using DNS. If the computer cannot resolve the hostname to an IP address, it won't be able to establish a connection.

## Task 08:
Category 5: Provides speeds up to 1,000 Mbps.

Category 6: Provides speeds up to 10,000 Mbps.

## Task 09:
**Reason:** To connect a switch with another switch, we generally need to use a crosover cable and while connecting a router to a PC, a straight-through cable is used. A crossover cable is designed to swap the transmit and receive pairs between the two devices while a straight-through cable has the same pin configuration on both ends.

## Task 10:
My home network features a basic star topology, which is a common layout for small-scale networks. The central hub of the network is a wireless router that serves as both the router and the switch. Various devices are connected to this router, forming a local area network.

**Components:**

* Wireless Router (Core device)

* Desktop Computers

* Laptop Computers

* Smartphones and Tablets

* Smart Home Devices
  
* Network Printer

**Advantages of the Topology:**

* The star topology simplifies network management as all devices are connected to a central hub, making it easier to monitor and troubleshoot.

* Adding new devices is straightforward; they can be connected to the router without disrupting the existing network.

* In the event of a device or cable failure, other devices on the network remain unaffected.

* Devices have individual connections to the router, reducing congestion and improving overall network performance.

Conclusion:
The star topology has proven effective for my home network due to its simplicity, ease of management, and reliable connectivity. It accommodates various devices used for work, entertainment, and smart home integration while ensuring optimal performance and scalability.
