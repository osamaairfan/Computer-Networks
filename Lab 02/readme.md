## Task 02:
### Switch:
1) Operates at Layer 2 of the OSI model i.e Data link layer.
2) Forwards data based on MAC addresses.
3) Create multiple collision domains to reduce collisions and reduce network performance.
4) Provides dedicated bandwidth per port.
5) Offers better security and efficiency.
6) More expensive and commonly used in modern networks.

### Hub:
1) Operates at Layer 1 i.e the physical link layer.
2) Broadcasts data to all connected devices.
3) Creates a single collision domain which slows down the network.
4) Shares bandwidth among all devices.
5) Offers lower security and efficiency.
6) Less common and less efficient in modern networks.

## Task 03:
### Physical Mode:
1) It involves physical hardware and its physical properties.
2) It deals with components like cables, device etc.
3) It focuses on maintenance and troubleshooting of hardware.
4) Example: Plugging in a computer system or fixing a broken cable.

### Logical Mode:
1) It involves intellectual, software-based concepts.
2) It deals with data organization, protocols, programming.
3) It focuses on setting up a software, data management, and designing algorithms.
4) Example: Sending messages on the internet or managing files on your computer system.
