## Wireshark Tasks:
### Task 01:
Source IP: `192.168.0.108`

Destination IP: `172.217.17.78`

### Task 02:
ICMP packet does not have source and destination port numbers beacause it was designed to communicate network-layer information between hosts and routers.

### Task 03:
ICMP Type: `8 (Echo (ping) request)`

ICMP Code: `0`

Additionally it also shows checksum, identifiers and sequence numbers as shown in the screenshot below:

### Task 04:
**Checksum:** 16 bits, equivalent to 2 bytes.

**Identifier:** 16 bits, equivalent to 2 bytes. It also depends on the specific ICMP message type and implementation.

**Sequence Numbers:** 16 bits, equivalent to 2 bytes. It also depends on the specific ICMP message type and implementation.

### Task 05:
ICMP Type: `0 (Echo (ping) reply)`

ICMP Code: `0`

Additionally it also shows checksum, identifiers and sequence numbers as shown in the screenshot below:
